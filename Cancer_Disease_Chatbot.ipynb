            "\n",
            "Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous.\n",

            "A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth. Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating.\n",

Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors. DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell's DNA and make corrections. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren't corrected, leading cells to become cancerous.\n",
            "\n",
            "These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer. But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer.\n",
            "\n",
            "What causes gene mutations?\n",
            "\n",
            "Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance:\n",
            "\n",
            "Gene mutations you're born with. You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers.\n",

            "You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers. Gene mutations that occur after birth. Most gene mutations occur after you're born and aren't inherited. A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens), obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake. Occasionally, a mistake is missed. This could cause a cell to become cancerous.\n",
            "\n",
            "How do gene mutations interact with each other?\n",
            "\n",
            "The gene mutations you're born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer.\n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, if you've inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn't mean you're certain to get cancer. Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form. It's likely that this varies among cancer types.\n",

            "\n",

            "Your age\n",
            "\n",
            "Cancer can take decades to develop. That's why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older. While it's more common in older adults, cancer isn't exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age.\n",

            "Your habits\n",
            "\n",
            "Certain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer. Smoking, drinking more than one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer.\n",
            "\n",
            "You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others.\n",

            "Your family history\n",
            "\n",
            "Only a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition. If cancer is common in your family, it's possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next. You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers. Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn't necessarily mean you'll get cancer.\n",

            "Your health conditions\n",
            "\n",
            "Some chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers. Talk to your doctor about your risk.\n",

            "Your environment\n",
            "\n",
            "The environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer. Even if you don't smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes. Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.\n",

destroy normal body tissue.', 'Cancer often has the ability to spread throughout your body.', 'Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the world.', 'But survival rates are improving for many types of cancer, thanks to improvements in cancer screening, treatment and prevention.', 'Symptoms\\n\\nSigns and symptoms caused by cancer will vary depending on what part of the body is affected.', \"Some general signs and symptoms associated with, but not specific to, cancer, include:\\n\\nFatigue\\n\\nLump or area of thickening that can be felt under the skin\\n\\nWeight changes, including unintended loss or gain\\n\\nSkin changes, such as yellowing, darkening or redness of the skin, sores that won't heal, or changes to existing moles\\n\\nChanges in bowel or bladder habits\\n\\nPersistent cough or trouble breathing\\n\\nDifficulty swallowing\\n\\nHoarseness\\n\\nPersistent indigestion or discomfort after eating\\n\\nPersistent, unexplained muscle or joint pain\\n\\nPersistent, unexplained fevers or night sweats\\n\\nUnexplained bleeding or bruising\\n\\nWhen to see a doctor\\n\\nMake an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that concern you.\", \"If you don't have any signs or symptoms, but are worried about your risk of cancer, discuss your concerns with your doctor.\", 'Ask about which cancer screening tests and procedures are appropriate for you.', 'Causes\\n\\nCancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells.', 'The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide.', 'Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous.', 'What do gene mutations do?', 'A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to:\\n\\nAllow rapid growth.', 'A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly.', 'This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation.', 'A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly.', 'This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation.', 'Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth.', 'Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell.', 'Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing.', 'A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating.', 'Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell.', 'Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing.', 'A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating.', 'Make mistakes when repairing DNA errors.', \"DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell's DNA and make corrections.\", \"A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren't corrected, leading cells to become cancerous.\", 'These mutations are the most common ones found in cancer.', 'But many other gene mutations can contribute to causing cancer.', 'What causes gene mutations?', \"Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance:\\n\\nGene mutations you're born with.\", 'You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents.', 'This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers.', 'You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents.', 'This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers.', 'Gene mutations that occur after birth.', \"Most gene mutations occur after you're born and aren't inherited.\", 'A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens), obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise.', 'Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth.', 'However, cells contain a mechanism that recognizes when a mistake occurs and repairs the mistake.', 'Occasionally, a mistake is missed.', 'This could cause a cell to become cancerous.', 'How do gene mutations interact with each other?', \"The gene mutations you're born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer.\", \"For instance, if you've inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn't mean you're certain to get cancer.\", 'Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer.', 'Your inherited gene mutation could make you more likely than other people to develop cancer when exposed to a certain cancer-causing substance.', \"It's not clear just how many mutations must accumulate for cancer to form.\", \"It's likely that this varies among cancer types.\", \"Risk factors\\n\\nWhile doctors have an idea of what may increase your risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don't have any known risk factors.\", 'Factors known to increase your risk of cancer include:\\n\\nYour age\\n\\nCancer can take decades to develop.', \"That's why most people diagnosed with cancer are 65 or older.\", \"While it's more common in older adults, cancer isn't exclusively an adult disease — cancer can be diagnosed at any age.\", 'Your habits\\n\\nCertain lifestyle choices are known to increase your risk of cancer.', 'Smoking, drinking more than one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men, excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer.', 'You can change these habits to lower your risk of cancer — though some habits are easier to change than others.', 'Your family history\\n\\nOnly a small portion of cancers are due to an inherited condition.', \"If cancer is common in your family, it's possible that mutations are being passed from one generation to the next.\", 'You might be a candidate for genetic testing to see whether you have inherited mutations that might increase your risk of certain cancers.', \"Keep in mind that having an inherited genetic mutation doesn't necessarily mean you'll get cancer.\", 'Your health conditions\\n\\nSome chronic health conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, can markedly increase your risk of developing certain cancers.', 'Talk to your doctor about your risk.', 'Your environment\\n\\nThe environment around you may contain harmful chemicals that can increase your risk of cancer.', \"Even if you don't smoke, you might inhale secondhand smoke if you go where people are smoking or if you live with someone who smokes.\", 'Chemicals in your home or workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, also are associated with an increased risk of cancer.', 'Complications\\n\\nCancer and its treatment can cause several complications, including:\\n\\nPain.', 'Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful.', 'Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain.', 'Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful.', 'Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain.', 'Fatigue.', 'Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed.', \"Fatigue
